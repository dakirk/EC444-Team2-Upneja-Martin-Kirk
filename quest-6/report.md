### Backend

We based this code off of the Quest 5 Node.js server, which uses TingoDB to store data. Each time the ESP32 transmits a spit time to the server, it stores it, along with the timestamp when it was received, in the databse. The server also provides an endpoint ```/logs```, which sends the database's contents as a JSON string. Additionally, the server can receive URL parameters (speed, steering, start/stop) for controlling the crawler, which are received from the ```/params``` endpoint as ```speed```, ```steer```, and ```start```. Speed and steering are received as Â±1, with the number added onto an internal speed value to control the direction of movement. The start parameter is binary, and toggles the crawler between moving and stopped. All of these instructions are passed on over UDP to the crawler.
